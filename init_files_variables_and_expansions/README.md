Shell, init files, variables and expansions

Shell: A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by executing commands. Common shells include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

Init files: Init files are scripts that are executed by the shell at startup. They can be used to configure the shell environment, define aliases and functions, and set variables.

Variables: Variables are used to store values that can be referenced and manipulated by shell scripts. They can be set using
 the "variable=value" syntax, and accessed using the "$variable" syntax.

Expansions: Expansions are used to manipulate variables or perform other operations within a shell script.
 Common expansions include command substitution (replacing a command with its output), parameter expansion (manipulating variable values),
 and arithmetic expansion (performing arithmetic operations).
