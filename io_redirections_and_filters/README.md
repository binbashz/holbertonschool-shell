Shell I/O Redirections and filters


In computing, a shell is a program that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services.
 Shell commands can be typed at a prompt to perform various tasks, such as managing files, launching applications, and configuring system settings.

I/O redirection allows users to change the input and output of shell commands.
 For example, the ">" symbol redirects output to a file,
 while the "<" symbol redirects input from a file. Pipes ("|") allow the output
 of one command to be used as the input for another command.

Filters are programs that modify or process text input in some way.
 Examples of filters include "grep", which searches for a pattern in text, and "sort",
 which sorts lines of text alphabetically or numerically. Filters can be combined using pipes to create more complex text processing workflows.
